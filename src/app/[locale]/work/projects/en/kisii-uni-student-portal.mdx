## Overview

Kisii University student portal was developed by a company known as ABNO Softwares International. In a span of five years, it has recieved only one interface design update. From a far observation, it can be assumed that the stakeholders hold to a phrase, "If it is working; do not touch it".
In  this project, I  focused on improving the user experience and the UI of the dashboard.

## User  Goals

- Able to report for session on time; within two weeks after session reporting is open.
- Book for acomodation in the institution's hostels. Booking is done prior to official reopenning of the institution after a closure at the end of every semester.
- Register for Units, special examination, Apply for retakes and other failed units; together with viewing for examination results and transcripts.
- View outstanding fee balances. Accessing fee statement and Fee structure for each academic year.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Figjam**: For documenting user flows.

## Challenges and Learnings

The greatest challenge was the limited access to real student data for indepth analysis posed a challenge in accurately understanding user needs and behaviours.
However, this project made me improve my skills in UI Design, User research and Information architecture.

## Next Steps ...

I presented my design during Kisii University Innovation Challenge, though it was not adopted for implementation, I still believe I gave my best shot on itâ˜º.
