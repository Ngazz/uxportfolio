## Overview

In Kenya's informal job market, accessing opportunities remains a challenge due to outdated reliance on personal networks. Bosses seeking workers
often depend on farmiliar clients, but when those clients are unreachable, unwell, unavailable or busy, Bosses are left stranded. 
Meanwhile, a significant number of skilled individuals remain invisible, disadvantaged by lack of direct connection to potential opportunities.

## Key Challenges

We decided to narrow down and focus on the following areas; as they formed the basis of our decisions towards design of a mobile application, digiKazi.

- Incase Labourous are unreachable via call or SMS, Bosses are left desperate since they have no other options and people to entrust.
- There is a challenge to determine authentic people, especially incase of referrals and or social media engagements.
- Due to competition for the available scarce opportunities, it is a challenge to determine whether gig or job is still available or already taken. This raises fear of asking for opportunities posted earlier.
- Prior knowledge of payable amount influences the uptake of the advertised opportunities. Most of Labourous prefer to be informed how much they will be paid for their service before assuming the task.

## Solution

To design and develop a digital solution that connect Bosses and skilled individuals enabling the smooth and efficient acquisition of informal tasks and gigs.



## Tools Used

- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Storybook**: For building an interactive, documented component library.
- **Figjam**: For documenting user flows.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge I faced was being a sole designer, all design decisions and approvals rested on my shoulders. However, this presented an opportunity
to collaborate with cross-functional teams, alligning efforts towards achieving the common goal. The collaboration enhanced my efficiency and accelarated task completion.


## Outcome

The app is currently on hold, pending approval from ICONS Hub director and other key stakeholders before it becomes available in the playstore.
